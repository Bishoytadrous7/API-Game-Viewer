# 🎮 Free-To-Play Games Viewer 

**Free-To-Play Games Viewer** is an interactive web app that allows users to explore random free-to-play games using the [FreeToGame API](https://www.freetogame.com/api-doc). Each game includes attributes like genre, platform, and publisher. Users can ban specific attributes to filter future results and view a running history of all previously discovered games during the session.
